# Spaceman WebSocket Demo

This is a simple demo of using WebSocket on GitHub Pages. It connects to a public echo WebSocket server and logs the messages.

## Features

- HTML + JavaScript only (no backend)
- Uses WebSocket to send/receive messages
- Can be deployed with GitHub Pages

## Run it live

You can host this by enabling GitHub Pages on your repository (Settings → Pages → choose branch and root folder).

## Note

This is a simulation only. Real casino WebSocket endpoints require authentication and CORS permissions.
